## Who I Am

I'm the developer who started by lying about my age to land contracts at 16, built a telecom platform processing 30M+ daily messages, and helped architect systems now valued at $150M. After 18 years in the trenches, I've learned that great software isn't just about clean code—it's about delivering measurable business impact.

## What I Build

- **High-Volume Processing Systems** that handle millions of transactions daily
- **AI/LLM Integration Platforms** that make complex technology accessible
- **Marketing Technology Solutions** that drive measurable ROI
- **Legacy System Transformations** that turn spaghetti code into scalable architecture
